/*
* The primary purpose of singletons is to make sure that we can create only one instance of a given type.
* Singletons work well when there is a single resource that needs to be accessed and managed throughout the application.
* As parallel and concurrent reads and writes produce data corruption, consequently causing the app to crash, making sure that
* both reads and writes do not execute in parallel, could be a solution. In other words, preventing both reads and writes
* occurring at the same time seems to solve the issue
